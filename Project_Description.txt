Project Description:

We implemented PA4 with one by one:

First of all, We started by reimplementing the Symbol Table in symtable.cc.

Then we start the IR generation process with global and function declaration in ast_decl.cc. This step involves adding some new necessary elements in VarDecl and FnDeclclasses to hold information about llvm::Value*

Then we tested thoroughly our implementation before moving on to the next step.

Next, we worked on getting all the expression correct. This is the hardest and most consuming part to work on. We spend 3 days finishing and polising all the expressions and their combination with others. 

Lastly, we finished with the ast_stmt.cc implementation to take care of BasicBlock position when using each of the individual or nested statements.

We tested our implementation incrementally one file by one before we tackle the nextfiles.
